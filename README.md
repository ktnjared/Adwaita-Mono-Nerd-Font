# Adwaita-Mono-Nerd-Font

GNOME's [Adwaita Mono](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-fonts) patched with Nerd Fonts

Patched using local patcher script also included in this repo.

## Install

You can either download the zip file in the releases or, if you're [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) savy, you can always install via my personal tap.
